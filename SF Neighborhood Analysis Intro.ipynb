    "\n",
    "The city of San Francisco has been one of the earliest responders to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, issuing stay-at-home orders to the people on March 14, 2020. The state of California would follow to issue a state-wide call to stay-at-home on March 20, 2020. Due to early response and strict guidelines, San Francisco is one of the large metropolitan areas in the US that has been keeping COVID-19 largely undercontrol, with a relatively low number of cases and deaths compared to its population (7,000 cases and 64 deaths out of over 800,000 residents).\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to understand the relationship between confirmed COVID-19 cases and San Francisco neighborhoods. As the city continues to re-open in the recent months, it is imperative to understand the relationship between the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and neighborhood composition, particularly its venues. Under the assumption that most individuals are infected outside of their home, we can consider each venue as a potential site of infection. Doing so, we can analyze the relationship between the types and numbers of venues in a neighborhood and its cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of this analysis would be invaluable for local policymakers looking to understand the impact of re-opened venues on COVID-19 cases. This will inform them in shaping re-opening policy for the city in order to maintain public safety while still stimulating the local economy.\n"

    "In order to correlate San Francisco COVID-19 cases and venues, we will be using two data sources: Four Square and DataSF.\n",

    "Four Square is a location technology platform that provides information on venues. It uses crowdsourced data to provide information on venues around a point of interest. The venue information consists of:\n",
    " - Venue name\n",
    " - Venue address\n",
    " - Venue type\n",
    " - Venue tips\n",
    " - Venue photos\n",
    "\n",
    "DataSF provides public datasets to the city departments of San Francisco. The dataset we will be using, will detail:\n",
    " - Medical provider confirmed COVID-19 cases\n",
    " - Medical provider confirmed COVID-19 related deaths\n",
    " - Neighborhood population\n",
